        Gym Codex does not use cookies, pixel tags, or similar tracking

        We use a session token stored in local storage on the staff/admin user's
        device to manage login sessions and authentication. This token is only
        used to identify the authenticated user during their active session and
        is not shared with any third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        The session token does not have an automatic expiry. You can clear it at
        any time by logging out or clearing your browser storage.
